Here, I will keep continually-updated reading course notes in the foundations of optimal transport that are substratic in neural contexts and its connections to operator learning. These reading course notes are in collaboration with Professor Ronghjie Lai in the mathematics department at Purdue University. These notes also contain neural strategies in these areas with relations to high-level research in these topics, such as deep JKO learning and large scale neural Wasserstein gradient flows.

Here, I will keep continually-updated reading course notes in the foundations of optimal transport that are key in neural contexts and their connections to operator learning. These reading course notes are in collaboration with Professor Rongjie Lai in the mathematics department at Purdue University. The primary goal of these notes is a deep understanding of the basics of variational partial differential equations, notably continuity and Fokker-Planck PDEs, and their relations to more data-driven scenarios, such as operator learning tasks and other various topics in ML and OT. These notes also contain neural strategies in these areas with relations to high-level research in these topics, such as deep JKO learning and large scale neural Wasserstein gradient flows.
